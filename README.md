These are mostly notes to self. To see the published blog, go to [dfm.io](https://dfm.io).

## Creating a new post

To create a new post, install [copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io) then run:

```bash
copier gh:dfm-io/template post--URL_SLUG_FOR_POST
```

Where `URL_SLUG_FOR_POST` is (gasp!) the URL slug for this post. Then the tradition is for this to be committed to a repo called `post--URL_SLUG_FOR_POST` under the `dfm-io` organization.
